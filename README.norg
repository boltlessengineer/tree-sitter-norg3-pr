* Tree-sitter parser for Norg syntax

** How to try it in Neovim

   You should manually bulid & register the parser to neovim.

   @code sh
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   @end

   @code vim
   :source register.lua
   " or you can paste the content of `init.lua` in your config.
   " you don't need nvim-treesitter to run this snippet
   @end

   #NOTE
   > You should disable [neorg]{https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg} plugin and
     uninstall existing norg parser to avoid conflict.
